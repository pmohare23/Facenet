Facenet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering

based on paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832

Trained Inception network to directly learn a 128-dimensional mapping (no intermediate bottleneck) from face images to a compact
Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity.
